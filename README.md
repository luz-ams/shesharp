The project is an App for recruiters who can FaceTime with their candidates. While the candidate is on the call, a summary of the current jobOpening and their matching skills will show-up in the screen. 

To remove gender-bias, the App will add a filter to the actual person being interviewed. The filters are cute little kittens! The name and surname of the candidates are hidden and only a nickname will show.
